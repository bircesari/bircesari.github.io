        <p>
            I'll be honest, I started Dr. Tana M. Session's course on DEIB data and metrics thinking I'd pick 
            up a few tips on tracking diversity numbers. What I got instead was a complete shift in how I 
            think about making real change happen inside organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>The Wake-Up Call</h2>
        <p>
            Here's the uncomfortable truth: many of us have been part of companies that talk a big game 
            about diversity and inclusion. We sit through trainings, we see updated mission statements, 
            maybe we even celebrate when hiring numbers look better. And then... very little changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            People still don’t feel like they belong. Talented employees from underrepresented groups 
            still leave. The culture still feels the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Session gets straight to the root of why this happens: we're measuring the wrong things, 
            or not measuring much at all beyond surface-level demographics.
        </p>

        <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>
        <p>
            The course drove home a truth that's obvious in hindsight but often ignored: if you can't 
            measure it, you can't manage it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But metrics shouldn't stop at counting heads. DEIB data needs to reflect <strong>experiences</strong>, 
            not just demographics. The course highlighted the indicators that actually show whether people 
            feel they belong:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Are people from diverse backgrounds being promoted at the same rates?</li>
            <li>What do exit interviews really reveal about why people leave?</li>
            <li>Do employee surveys show different experiences across different groups?</li>
            <li>Are diverse voices actively shaping decisions, or just present in the room?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Messy Middle</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most valuable parts was learning about the roadblocks to collecting meaningful data.
            Sometimes it's technical, disconnected systems, missing survey questions, inconsistent reporting. 
            But just as often, it's cultural.
        </p>

        <p>
            People are afraid of what the data might expose. They worry about privacy. Or they're simply 
            reluctant to disrupt the status quo.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Session doesn't sugarcoat this reality. She acknowledges that meaningful organizational 
            change is uncomfortable, slow, and requires persistence. But she also provides practical ways 
            to handle resistance and keep moving forward.
        </p>

        <h2>Making It Your Own</h2>
        <p>
            What clicked for me was realizing that DEIB cannot be a one-size-fits-all program copied from 
            another company. A tech startup, a manufacturing plant, and a hospital each have entirely 
            different cultural dynamics and structural challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
            The course gave me a framework for tailoring DEIB metrics to fit the actual state of an 
            organization, not an idealized version of what it <em>should</em> look like.
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s not about achieving some abstract version of “perfect diversity.” It’s about 
            understanding your culture, identifying the gaps, and creating accountability to close them.
        </p>

        <h2>The Work Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            I’m leaving the course with more questions than answers, in the best possible way. I'm thinking 
            differently about how to turn employee feedback into real, trackable goals. I'm more aware of 
            the need to manage expectations around how long meaningful culture change takes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most importantly, I'm convinced that sustainable DEIB work requires both empathy and analytics.
            We need to care deeply about people while also having the discipline to measure progress with 
            honesty and courage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Session’s expertise as an organizational development strategist shines in how she connects 
            these dots. This isn't theory, it's practical wisdom shaped by real organizational challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Turn</h2>
        <p>
            If you're working on DEIB within your organization, I'm curious: What’s been your biggest 
            challenge? Are you measuring the right things? How are you navigating the gap between where 
            you are and where you want to be?
        </p>

        <p>
            None of us have this fully figured out, but conversations like these help us move closer to 
            meaningful, human-centered change.
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed this course through LinkedIn Learning, which offers PDUs for those tracking 
            continuing education credits.
